## My process
I've done some challenges before but this was the hardest by far. 

I had a lot of problems doing drowdown menu. It took me some hours to adjust the menu without affect the rest of the header flow. I tried to keep the space between the main menu and the drowdown menu but hover effect wasn't working correctly so I had to remove it.
Final result it's not perfect but I think it looks not bad.

Positioning the images of sections was not easy. I needed a lot of changes before getting images with hidden overflow.


### Built with

- BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties


### Continued development

This was my first project using JS. It is only a tiny bit for the mobile version so I would like to keep improving this part.

I want to learn better the BEM methodology and be able to implement it correctly.
